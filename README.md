   - AWS Cognito handles authentication via user pools.

2. **Request Processing**:
   - Authenticated requests pass through the Internet Gateway.
   - AWS Shield protects against potential DDoS attacks.

3. **Application Logic Execution**:
   - AWS Lambda functions execute application code in response to events.
   - Lambda functions interact with other AWS services as needed.

## **9. Application Logic**

This application is designed to collect data from PayPal webhooks and append it to a Google Sheet. The main flow is as follows:

1. Webhook Verification and Data Collection
Webhook Event: The application listens for PayPal webhook events, specifically targeting PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED events.
Verification: Each webhook event is verified to ensure it comes from PayPal and contains the required data.
Data Parsing: If the event is verified, relevant payment details are extracted. This includes:
Transaction ID
Payer’s email address
Payment amount
Currency code
Transaction timestamp
2. Google Sheets Integration
Service Authorization: The application uses OAuth 2.0 for secure access to the Google Sheets API. It checks for a valid token, refreshing if necessary, or prompting reauthorization if no valid token exists.
Data Appending: Once authorized, the application appends the extracted payment data to a predefined range (Sheet1!A:E) in the Google Sheet.
3. Error Handling and Response
Error Handling: If there’s an issue with Google Sheets API access or data processing, the application logs the error and returns an appropriate HTTP status code.
Response: For successful processing, the application returns a 200 OK response with a success message. If the webhook is invalid, it returns a 400 Bad Request.
4. Future Data Integration
In future enhancements, collected data from Google Sheets will be synchronized with AWS services for further processing:

&nbsp;Amazon S3: To store and organize raw data files.

&nbsp;Amazon Athena: To enable SQL-based queries for data visualization and analytics.

&nbsp;Amazon DynamoDB (if needed): To manage structured data for quick access and integration with other applications.

This setup allows real-time data collection from webhooks, centralized storage in Google Sheets, and integration with AWS for advanced data analysis and visualization.
